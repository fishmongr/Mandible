* Welcome

Mandible is a build and development toolset pulled from SocialGenius's
[[http://www.audiovroom.com/][Audiovroom]], open-sourced for your using pleasure.

Audiovroom is the popular HTML5 Facebook Mobile app that lets you play your
friends like radio stations, across any browser or device.

* Mandible
- is a collection of open-source and custom tools for organizing and prepping a web app for production.
- is targetted toward web apps built on JavaScript MVC frameworks (we love [[http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/][Backbone]]).
- gives your web app a (customizable) folder structure for development and production.
- concatinates and minifies your CSS and JS files.
- allows you to create your own folder hierarchy of JavaScript templates.
- creates and maintains your production assets (css, js, templates).
- includes a copy of [[http://getskeleton.com/][Skeleton]] to get you started with a [[http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/][responsive]] design.
- can watch for CSS and template changes and concat them on the fly.
- Includes a makeFile for concating JS, CSS, and concating templates in one easy step.

* Mandible works by
- compressing and minifying your CSS with [[http://sass-lang.com/][Sass]].
- compresses and minifying your JS with [[https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS][UglifyJS]].
- externalizing your JavaScript templates and watching for changes with [[https://github.com/krunkosaurus/NodeInterval][NodeInterval]].

* Requirements
  To use this tools you need to have the following installed:
- You need to install Ruby (already installed on all macs).
- You need to install [[http://sass-lang.com/][Sass]]. =sudo gem install sass=
- You need to instal [[http://nodejs.org/][Node]]. (Compile it from [[http://nodejs.org/#download][here]].)

* To use
** For developers:
1. In terminal, run the two shell scripts in =/bin=. Keep them open while you do your development and all your CSS and templates changes are automatically merged into the production ready files.
2. While working, view your changes in =/assets/index_uncompressed.html=
3. When you're done for the day, compress your JavaScript files by typing =make= in the root project folder. In case your bin scripts are off, this will also automatically compress all CSS, JS, and rerender the templates - but only when necessary.
4. Verify the production file at =/assets/index.html=.
** For build managers:
1. Simply type =make -B= to force all CSS, JS, and templates processes to run. Push to production box(es) and / or CDN.

* Explanation of application architecture
: .
: ├── /assets                        <-- "Production" folder container html and compressed assets.
: │   ├── index.html                 <-- The production-ready file you want to view to launch this webapp.
: │   └── index_uncompressed.html    <-- The uncompressed js prod version with templates, use this during daily development.
: ├── /src                           <-- "Development" folder container html and uncompressed assets.
: │   ├── index.html                 <-- Prod file without templates. Just used to generate real prod file. Never use it.
: │   └── index_uncompressed.html    <-- Dev index file with raw js. Do your development here.
: ├── /bin                           <-- Dev shell scripts.
: │   ├── sass-watch.sh              <-- Run this in another terminal tab to watch for css changes. It will automatically concat and minify to assets/css
: │   └── template-watch.sh          <-- Run this in another terminal tab to watch for template changes. All templates get concatinated into assets/*.html files.
: ├── /vendor                        <-- Open-source shell scripts referenced by /bin scripts.
: └── makefile                       <-- make utility for concatinating and minifying all js (and css and templates) to assets folder.

* Aditional tips
- You should probably put production ready folders =assets/js= and =assets/js= under =.gitignore= so they aren't comitted to your repository.

* Q&A
- What is the heck are Javascript templates? Reusable markup in a JavaScrip tag. See here [[http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/][link]].

* Projects we use and recommend:
- [[http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/][backbone.js]] - MVC JavaScript framework that utilizes [[http://jquery.com/][jQuery]] and
  [[http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/][underscore.js]].
  Underscore's templating ability is especially useful.
- [[http://getskeleton.com/][Skeleton]] - Grid-based CSS layout system to allow content to reflow to various
  browser widths.
- [[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/][Facebook JavaScript SDK]] - The JavaScript SDK provides a rich set of
  client-side functionality for accessing Facebook's server-side API calls.
- [[http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/][Soundmanager 2]] - Cross-browser audio support.
- [[http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4][iScroll 4]] - JS lib for native scrolling ability in subsections.
- [[http://sass-lang.com/][Sass]] - Ruby Gem for organizing and minifying CSS.
- [[https://github.com/krunkosaurus/NodeInterval][Node Interval]] - Node utility for managing and concatenating template files.
